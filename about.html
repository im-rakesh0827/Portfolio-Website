            <h2>
                An online voting system is a software platform that allows groups to securely conduct votes and elections. High-quality
                online voting systems balance ballot security, accessibility, and the overall requirements of an organization's voting
                event.
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h3>
                At their core, online voting systems protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from being able to vote
                multiple times. As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to gather in-person, cast votes using paper, or by any
                other means (e.g. email, insecure survey software).
                
                You may hear an online voting system being referred to as an online election system, an online e voting system, or
                electronic voting. These all make reference to the same thing: a secure voting tool that allows your group to collect
                input from your group and closely scrutinize the results in real time.
                
                Keep reading for access to the most comprehensive online voting system introduction you will find.

        <h1>Purpose : </h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="purpose">
            <h2>
                Online voting tools and online election voting systems help you make important decisions by gathering the input of your
                group in a way that’s systematic and verifiable.
                
                Oftentimes, these decisions are made on a yearly basis - during an event (e.g. your organization’s AGM) or at a
                particular time of the year. Or you might run ongoing polls amongst your group (e.g. anonymous employee feedback
                surveys).
            </h2>
            <br>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <h2>Elect your leadership : </h2>
                </li>
                <h3>
                    A board of directors election is a good example, where there are multiple positions (e.g. chair, vice president,
                    secretary, treasurer). All of which may include supporting documentation (e.g. biographies, resumés, headshots).
                </h3>
                <li>
                    <h2>Admit new members to your group : </h2>
                </li>
                <h3>This helps you stick to a regular, fair process of evaluation and lets candidates know what to expect.</h3>
                <li>
                    <h2>Gather anonymous feedback from your employees : </h2>
                </li>
                <h3>
                    Managers (and managers of managers) want to know how their employees truly feel about their jobs and work life.
                    Using an
                    online voting system with a capacity for secret balloting helps employees express their true feelings, by
                    understanding
                    and trusting that their feedback will be heard, but not tied directly to them.
                </h3>
                <li>
                    <h2>Vote on yearly budgets : </h2>
                </li>
                <h3>
                    And since adjustments to your budget are often needed, an online voting system will keep voting secure and
                    accessible -
                    no matter where the members of your group may happen to be.
                </h3>
            
                <li>
                    <h2>Alter your operational procedures and bylaws : </h2>
                </li>
                <h3>
                    Just like leadership elections, expect group members to react strongly toward changes - no matter how minor - to
                    organizational processes. You’ll want to collect individual responses to these changes in a systematic manner.
                </h3>

            <ul>
                <li><h2>Cost Savings and Efficiency : </h2></li>
                <h3>
                    The cost savings and efficiencies you’ll gain are unparalleled to any other method of voting. Groups switching to
                    web-based online voting systems from more expensive and less efficient voting technologies like voting machines,
                    paper
                    ballots, and in-person meetings will reap these benefits without increasing risk.
                </h3>

                <li><h2>Voter Accessibility : </h2></li>
                <h3>
                    Needing to fly halfway around the world to vote at your organization’s annual meeting is an example of a vote with low
                    accessibility. On the other hand, tapping a link on your mobile device that securely logs you into the online voting
                    system website is an example of a vote or election with high accessibility.
                    
                    High accessibility generates greater turnout rates among your group.
                </h3>
                <li><h2>Auditability and Verifiability : </h2></li>
                <h3>
                    With an online voting system, you can easily showcase election results to eliminate concern. Sharing all administrator
                    activity during your election to prove no one went in altered the results is just one of the many trust-building tactics
                    you’ll be able to use in light of a vote challenge.
                </h3>

                <li><h2>Security, Confidence, and Trust in Your Election Results : </h2></li>
                <h3>
                    The confidence in your voting and election results is by far the most valuable aspect that online voting systems will
                    offer to your group. The fallout of a vote being perceived as unfair is expensive, time-consuming, and wrecks havoc on
                    the hard-earned trust you’ve built among group members. From this perspective, an online voting system offers
                    unparalleled election security.
